# Chapter 15: Base Graphics  

# One of the greatest strengths of R, relative to other programming languages, 
# is the ease with which we can create publication-quality graphics. In this 
# lesson, you'll learn about base graphics in R.

# We do not cover the more advanced portions of graphics in R in this lesson.
# These include lattice, ggplot2 and ggvis.

# There is a school of thought that this approach is backwards, that we should
# teach ggplot2 first. See
# http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/ for an outline of
# this view.

# Load the included data frame cars with data(cars).

data(cars)

# To fix ideas, we will work with simple data frames. Our main goal is to
# introduce various plotting functions and their arguments. All the output 
# would look more interesting with larger, more complex data sets.
